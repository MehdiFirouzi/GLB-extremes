## Reproducibility Note

All analysis scripts required to reproduce the results are provided in this repository.  
Due to data volume, raw and intermediate processed climate datasets are not included.

## Users must:

1. Obtain the original reanalysis datasets from their respective providers (See the download scripts in notebooks/: https://github.com/MehdiFirouzi/GLB-extremes/tree/main/notebooks)

2. Execute the preprocessing scripts included in this repository.

3. Update local input and output directory paths in the scripts/notebooks to match their system configuration.

Several scripts contain author-specific local file paths (e.g., `D:\...`). These must be modified before execution.

The workflow is organized into data preparation, extreme index calculation, statistical evaluation, and figure generation modules.
