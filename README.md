# GLB-extremes

This repository contains code and minimal data to reproduce analyses and figures for:

"Intercomparison of reanalysis datasets for capturing precipitation and temperature extremes over the Great Lakes Basin."



**Contents**

* 
* src/indices/ – scripts for calculating ETCCDI temperature and precipitation extreme indices
* 
* src/figures/ – scripts for generating publication figures
* 
* notebooks/ – Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and demonstrations
* 
* config/ – configuration files (YAML/JSON) for study settings, paths, and index lists
* 
* data/raw/ – local storage for original datasets (excluded from Git)
* 
* data/processed/ – local storage for processed datasets (excluded from Git)
* 
* figures/ – generated figures for the paper



**Data Access**

Full reanalysis datasets are available from their respective providers (links in src/data\_prep/).

Processed datasets are too large to include; however, figure-ready index results are provided in this repository or via the linked data DOI.
